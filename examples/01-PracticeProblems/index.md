# MTC Practice Problems
Contributors: Pavel Dimitrov


This set of practice problems aims to introduce the MTC environment and capabilities while building a sense for how certain thermal transport and conjugate heat transfer problems may be solved. The problems are organized in 3 sets:

1. [**Set 1**](set1-heat-diffusion.md) relies on the Turotial and reinforces the initial concepts using simple 1D heat transport (diffusion only) 1D problems. 
    - **Problem 1:** Introduces solving problems with multiple domains having compatibility constraints at their interfaces
    - **Problem 2:** Introduces exact boundary conditions and why thei are useful
    - **Problem 3:** Builds on Problem 2 and returns to paramerization in this context to provide an opportunity to build an interactive parameter exploration tool

2. [**Set 2**](set2-cfd.md) moves to fluid dynamics and 2D problems to exercise building geometries and to highlight the importance of Integral Constraints. It introduces the need for non-uniform weighting during training.

3. [**Set 3**](set3-cht.md) Combines ideas from the previous two sets to develop a conjugate heat transfer problem. It introduces multi-stage training in MTC and provides an illustration of the benefits of separating problem formulation from how the solution is obtained.
