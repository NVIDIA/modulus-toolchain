## Simple 1D Wave Equation

This is a translation of the [1D Wave Equation problem](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/user_guide/foundational/1d_wave_equation.html) in the original Modulus documentation.
Create a new MTC project -- say, `mtc create wave1d` -- and update the `problem.py` to look like [wave_1d_problem.py](wave_1d_problem.py).
